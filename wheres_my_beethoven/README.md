Hello!

This is my own personal project. 
I made this because I myself would like to have a web page where I can find concerts based upon composer,
so that I don't have to search on multiple concert venues to find it. 

I am not a frontend developer, nor am I fullstack. I like backend. 
So the webpage won't be the most refined or dynamic, but hopefully the backend will be kickass (once i get started).


Best regards,
